#![doc = r#"Pathmod Core â€” runtime types for composable field accessors

This crate provides the runtime `Accessor<T, F>` type used by the derive macros in
`pathmod_derive` and re-exported by the `pathmod` crate. An `Accessor<T, F>` is a
small, `Copy` value that focuses into a field `F` within a root `T`.

Highlights
- Zero-cost composition: `Accessor` stores a byte offset from `&T` to `&F`; composing
  accessors is O(1) offset addition.
- Safe surface: All public APIs are safe. Internals use pointer arithmetic; constructors
  compute valid offsets for you.
- Clear clone semantics (MVP): `set_clone` only requires `F: Clone` and does not require
  `T: Clone`, even when composed deeply.

Quick example
```rust
use pathmod_core::Accessor;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Bar { x: i32 }
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
struct Foo { a: i32, b: Bar }

fn acc_b() -> Accessor<Foo, Bar> {
    fn get_ref(f: &Foo) -> &Bar { &f.b }
    fn get_mut(f: &mut Foo) -> &mut Bar { &mut f.b }
    Accessor::from_fns(get_ref, get_mut)
}
fn acc_x() -> Accessor<Bar, i32> {
    fn get_ref(b: &Bar) -> &i32 { &b.x }
    fn get_mut(b: &mut Bar) -> &mut i32 { &mut b.x }
    Accessor::from_fns(get_ref, get_mut)
}

let mut foo = Foo { a: 1, b: Bar { x: 2 } };
let acc = acc_b().compose(acc_x());
acc.set_mut(&mut foo, |v| *v += 5);
assert_eq!(foo.b.x, 7);
```

Safety notes
- Internally, accessors are represented by a byte offset and use unsafe pointer arithmetic
  to project fields. The public API is safe when accessors are constructed by the provided
  derive macros or `from_fns`.
